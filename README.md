# Student Amazon Product Search GUI

## Overview
This project is the final project for University of Houston - Downtown's Java course. It involves creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows students to search for products on Amazon and display the fetched data. The data is retrieved using the Rainforest API, and the GUI provides a seamless search experience for students.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for students to input their search queries.
- **Amazon Product Search**: Utilizes the Rainforest API to fetch relevant product data based on the student's input.
- **Data Display**: Displays the fetched product data in a user-friendly manner on the GUI.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the project.
- **Swing**: Java's GUI toolkit used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Rainforest API**: Used to fetch product data from Amazon based on search queries.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
4. Set up the Rainforest API credentials in the project (refer to Rainforest API documentation for instructions).
5. Build and run the project.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the search query for the desired product into the search bar.
3. Press the search button or hit enter to initiate the search.
4. The application will fetch relevant product data from Amazon using the Rainforest API.
5. The fetched data will be displayed on the GUI interface.
6. Explore the displayed product information.
